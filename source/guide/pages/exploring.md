# Exploration

Provided that you are at least 50% built on your available planet space, you will be able to send exploration ships to unclaimed planets. Each planet does not need to be halfway built, only that the total number of buildings in your empire must be 50% of the total max space available on planets under your control. Sending an exploration ship gets more expensive according to how many planets you control and how far away the planet you want to explore is from the nearest planet you control. There is a limit of 8 exploration ships that you are allowed to construct in any 24 hour period.
