# Creating an Empire

## Choosing a Galaxy

A Galaxy is defined by a specific map and set of rules. You can play in as few or as many as you'd like. A Galaxy resets after a round, which typically lasts from 6 to 8 weeks.

There are usually several available galaxies, and each caters to a certain playstyle. The description for each galaxy will offer some insight as far as what to expect.

## Choosing a Race

Your empire's dominant race will determine the following:

* bonuses and penalties
* available spells and operations
* unit and building availability

You can choose between 5 Standard Races or create a custom race.  Standard races are recommended for new players.

## Choosing a Leader and Empire Name

Lastly, you'll want to choose a Leader and Empire name.  Your leader name is how people will address you, and your empire name is what will represent you in your family and on the map.  Together they will look like: "Leader of Empire".  For example, "Alexander of Macedonia".

## Joining a Family

Now that you're all set, it's time to join your selected galaxy and land in your new team!  Imperial Conflict calls this your family, and these are the empires that share your home system (starting position on the map).
