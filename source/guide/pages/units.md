In units, you can build more units for service in your empire's military forces. These units will be placed in your main fleet when they are ready to serve you. If you want them to be stationed on a particular planet you will have to do that later, in the planets screen.

To build some units, you simply enter the desired amount in one or several of the text boxes next to the units. As long as your resources allow it, your orders will be carried out, and the units will join the main fleet as soon as they are ready. Each unit will cost you 1 cash and 1 food per week (except for Droids, which need no food).

Exploration Ship
To colonize uninhabited worlds, exploration ships are used. They are filled with colonists seeking a fresh start. They also typically have very poor defenses. Because of not having enough volunteers for such a dangerous mission, you can only build up to 6 exploration ships a day. You can send your exploration ships by clicking on an empty planet on the map.
