# Your Family

After you decide which galaxy you will want to join, you have your own planet in a system called your home system.  In this system are other empires and their home planets.  These empires are your family members, and this is your family.  This is your team.

You can view your family's page by clicking the "Family" link on the left sidebar.  This will show you all the other empires that are in your family, along with a subnavigation with other relevant links.

One of the first things you want to do is post in your family's forum to introduce yourself.  A lot of good planning happens here and it's a great place to offer help and/or ask questions.

The Family can elect a Leader. The Leader can post messages, which are shown on your Empire Overview. Each member can cast his vote for a player to become Leader, so if you are not happy with your current one, you can vote for someone else.
