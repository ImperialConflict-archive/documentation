# Page: Planets

This is a list of all your planets. You can sort them by coordinates, overbuilt, and resources. It also shows your laser count, whether or not there are stationed units, and if the planet is portaled or not.

Portals

Costs:	
15000(+planets*1000) gold
400 iron
80 octarine
20 food
110 endurium
40 weeks build time

Portals need a explanation. The portals are used for instant transportation. When you send your fleet from one portaled planet to another you are instantly at your destination. Otherwise it could take many weeks to reach a planet.

This gives some obvious military advantages, if a planet with a portal gets attacked every military unit in the main fleet will be able to rush to the defense. Also if you choose to travel to another planet you will automatically take the portal to the planet with a portal that is closest to the target.

Portals are very costly and take quite some time to build even with research points.

You can build portals in the planets screen. The costs to build a portal are increased by 1000 cash for every planet you own. Also the networth of your empire and your construction science can affect the costs. The exact formula for the cash costs is:

Portal Cost = [15000*(1+nwpenalty%)/(1+science%)]+1000*planets
